# # Stanford-40 Action Classifier

A simple PyTorch project that trains a ResNet-18 model on the Stanford-40 Actions dataset and classifies custom images. Includes a basic training loop, validation, model saving, and an inference script. Diagrams below show the overall workflow.

To Use single_image_predict.py you must have stanford40_resnet18.pth in the correct directory.
